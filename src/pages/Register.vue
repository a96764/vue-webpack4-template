        <p>
      “Most who come to Onga aren’t looking for just one aspect of health; they’re looking for an adventure that addresses the neglected parts. Maybe it’s physical, maybe it’s spiritual, maybe it’s just a nature deficit. It’s hard to know what we are missing until we’ve found it.”

      – Laura Mendoza, co-founder.
